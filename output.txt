<|startoftext|> [Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Just imagine that you're gonna stay like this forever
And I'll never have time to fight back
Cause you just never thought it was gonna end that way

There's nothing we can do to make that end any better
Right?
[Chorus]
I was in a tunnel on top of a hill
Wake up and think about how we did it

[Applause]
I don't know if it's ever gonna get over
Maybe I'm just gonna have to prove something to myself
But I'll never give up
I'm never gonna give up
Cause I'm gonna find someone I can trust

[Crescendo]
Crazy love coming up your ass
Loveclude your
Yeah, I love you too, I love you

[Crescendo]
Mmm, yeah, I think I'm gonna make you cry

You just don't believe me
Cause you don't even know what that means

[Crescendo]
Come on, girl
Mmmm, yeah, you did it

See, I mean it's just, you just love me, I know what you mean
And I'll leave you alone
[Chorus]
[End]<|endoftext|>
