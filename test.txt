<|startoftext|> It's me, hi 
It's me, hi 
 [Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
You seem like a boy
Well I'm guessing I'm younger then you
[Chorus]
I'll never be your friend again
Even the best you're like 
Breathe more on the way out
Sometimes I'm trying to forget you
I just love you back here
We always have your back, and your back at home
But my back is where I love you,
And you'll always be with me
Oh, my goodness, my goodness,
I need it
[Chorus]
It's my goodbye song, now, now, now, 
[Resolution]
[Time]
A beautiful woman put my heart into my voice
Somewhere in my heart's right
She says 
[Verse 2]
You never leave
Lucky, man, now
Your part is mine, man, now
And you can never tell me where
You were when you left me
When you asked me to sing
How could I let you down
I'm guessing I'm younger than you
Well I'm guessing I'm older then you
[Chorus]
I get older, but just never wiser
You seem like a boy
Well I'm guessing I'm younger then you
 [Verse 3]
What a handsome soul
If you were a son
And you'd let me down, but tell me where you were,
And tell me where you were when you<|endoftext|>
