<|startoftext|> [Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Taylor Swift...
Taylor Swift
[Chorus]
[At this point I had been getting into a moment of anger, to the point where I thought, "Taylor Swift's the face of the apocalypse"<|endoftext|>
