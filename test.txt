Why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in? I want to play tricks on you?"

"Yeah," said Wolfman. "But it's only gonna get worse with each passing day."

Havanna laughed. "Oh, yeah, I'll have to play that card the next time I meet you in the ring. It's the game I used to play before it was invented by the Joker."

They had gone down a different route than her, and the score changed instantly. Their bodies were flush with the red of their sun, making their eyes look like a pond, and there was an unmistakable rush of adrenaline. They tried not to get hurt when he slammed his fist into them, and they could feel the pain pulsing through their body and they took it in.

Havanna walked to the ring, held it, pulled her friend's hand, and as they walked into the ring, HAVANA pulled away.

"So where's Cassie?" she asked, looking down at the crowd.

"There's a storm in the room, but it's really quiet," said HAVANA. "And that's just you and me, and I need you to get your attention."

"Okay," said Cassie.

"You're right," said HAVANA. "I guess we'll just see what happens."

The rest of the night wasn't pretty, and HAVANA heard Cassie's cries for help<|endoftext|>
